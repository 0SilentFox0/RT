# RT
The final project in Unit Factory (Graphics) 

To compile just use "make"

use scenes from folder "scenes"

Also you there are some binds "W/A/S/D/R/F/T/G/Z/C" - to move camera (it will be faster if you will use Pixelview - "P")

And of course you can use simple Gui (yes, button "Close" does't work sorry)
